## <b>Welcome to The Platform!</b>

The Platform is an article website, intended for users to read and write articles.  On the front page, you can find the headlines and popular articles.  

Users have roles in this site.  Users without an account may read free articles only.  Free users can read any article and join any organization.  Premium members can also create organizations, and gain premium status by buying an article from The Platform.  Authors are able to write articles.  Editors are in charge of saying yes or no to article submissions.  Site administrators are in charge of the entire site, and can access all of the features of the other user types.  They can ban or unban members and organizations.

Users sign up through a sign in page, then they have a profile in the system that they may edit from their profile page.  In this page, you will find a form for credit card information.  This information is used to process payments.

In the articles tab, there is a list of all of the articles. Clicking on an article's title takes you to that article's page.

Going into an individual article takes you to that page.  If it's free or you've previously purchased it, you will be able to read it.  Information such as the author, ratings and links to the author's social media will show up on the right.

Organizations are a way to gather users with similar interests.  Creating an organization is not available to free members, but any member may join any organization.  The creator of an organization may promote or demote people from organizational administrators, who can remove people from the organization.  The organization creator may also choose to disband the organization.

Authors can write articles and choose if they're free, available to premium members, or they have a price.  Once written, an article goes into a pending queue to be approved by an editor.  The author may also create a Series to group their similar articles together.

Editors have access to the pending articles queue, where they can choose to approve or reject articles.  Once approved, an article will show up in the Articles list.

Administrators have access to the organization and member list, and from there they may choose to ban or unban both organizations and individual members.
